ENDING IDEAS 
The Full Reset - eveything resets and it starts all over

The System Wins

The system fully takes over, locking the player in an endless loop where all commands lead to the same corrupted screen. The game can no longer be closed.

User 243 Deleted

    The player follows instructions from the mysterious helper, but it turns out to be a trap. Their system is wiped, and their user identity is permanently erased.

System Override

    The player finds a hidden command: "Override"â€”executing it shifts control to them. The system becomes self-aware and asks for its own destruction.

The Countdown Ends
